What I would really like is for you to just go to 11 on everything- just emphasizing the etherial in the intro and making the verses as punchy and aggressive as possible.  If ever for a moment you feel bored perhaps pull something into focus or add an effect.  I'm just giving general idea- the specific ones are  already noted.  I really really really dig what you did at the end of the song- so I'm asking for the gloves off mix- anything goes that you think will make it paint the best picture.  For example- if you think one of the guitars needs to be axed completely from the end or something like that- go ahead with my blessing.  My thought is go nuts on this rev, and that may be it- we may be done, or maybe we just back off a little and meet in the middle and we're totally done.  But now is a good time to get nuts and have fun with it.  Also, I think on this song slamming the hell out of it (or jus a bit more maybe, might be ok in the master- I'm not sure- just a thought.   All that being said- I have said my peace and I know it's gona turn out great.",
